                        As a project is unique, it typically includes collaborators who do not usually work together. In
                        fact, the collaborators often come from different organizations, disciplines, and even
                        countries. Examples of projects may include the construction of a new bridge or building or
                        developing software for an improved business process. A relief effort for a natural disaster, or
                        setting up a strategy to break into a new sales geographic market are also projects. If you want
                        to complete a project on time, you need to manage it well. You also need to make sure you are
                        within budget. Not only must you work to meet deadlines but you also have to make sure that
                        quality does not suffer. Project management, therefore, is the application of techniques, tools,
                        skills, and knowledge to make sure all project requirements are met. Until the middle of the
                        last century, project management was an informal activity. At DOUBLE OH AY Enterprises when
                        tend to offer the above and lots more.

                        Training is teaching, or developing in oneself or others, any skills and knowledge or fitness
                        that relate to specific useful competencies. Training has specific goals of improving one's
                        capability, capacity, productivity and performance. It forms the core of apprenticeships and
                        provides the backbone of content at institutes of technology (also known as technical colleges
                        or polytechnics). In addition to the basic training required for a trade, occupation or
                        profession, training may continue beyond initial competence to maintain, upgrade and update
                        skills throughout working life. People within some professions and occupations may refer to this
                        sort of training as professional development. Training also refers to the development of
                        physical fitness related to a specific competence, such as sport, martial arts, military
                        applications and some other occupations. At DOUBLE OH AY Enterprise we are ready to Train and
                        Educate you anytime.
